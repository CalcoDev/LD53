# Le Laitier

Get ready to drink milk, slide through bad guys, and **drink even more milk**, while working for the IBP Milk Delivery Service, in this post-apocalyptic, robot run world. **Will you make it to the end without a drop spilled, or will you leave a glaring white trace for your fellow milkmen to follow**?

**DISCLAIMER**: I made this game in 48 hours, with the Compo in mind. As I was making this page, however, it occurred to me I used an already-existing song, which I just jumbled up a bit. As such, I am listing the game in the Jam section.
